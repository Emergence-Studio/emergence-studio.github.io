      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">About Jameson Lee</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Prior to founding Emergence Studio, Jameson Lee served organizations, both large and small, in a variety of strategic capacities. Most recently, he was a strategic solution architect at Moveworks, where he designed, scaled, and implemented enterprise-wide, conversational AI platforms. Jameson began his career at Goldman Sachs, and over the past 10 years, he has applied his understanding of data science, software engineering, and sales to develop a solution for a space that is deeply meaningful to him: community building.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        The experiences and connections of the past decade have taught Jameson the value of community and have been the driving inspiration for how he's developed the playbook for community-driven growth. His mission is simple: to bring world-class, flexible toolkits to community builders so that they can focus on fostering and transferring those in-person interactions into a digital environment where they can continue the conversation.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        When not working on Emergence, Jameson can be found working on his yoga practice, playing tennis, traveling, and writing (mostly about science fiction and AI). He is based out of New York City.
